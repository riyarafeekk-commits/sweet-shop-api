Developed a Spring Boot–based backend API for a Sweet Shop Management System with JWT-based authentication, role-based authorization, and secure RESTful endpoints backed by PostgreSQL.

Implemented USER and ADMIN roles to control access to sensitive operations such as adding sweets, restocking inventory, deleting items.

Designed and implemented core business logic, entity modeling, repositories, and API flows manually, following standard backend architecture practices.

Used ChatGPT and Google Gemini selectively to review security logic, validate JWT token handling, and debug authentication and authorization flows.

All APIs were tested using Postman, including authentication flows, role-based access control, inventory operations, and error handling (401/403/400 cases), to verify correctness and security.
